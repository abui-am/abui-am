## Prologue: Code, Rain, and Capucinno
The evening breeze of a still-cold spring blew quickly through the air between us.

This man beside me is `Abuidillah Adjie Muliadi` you can call him `Abui`, your daily average `19's` figure who happens to be in his middle life crisis. While he looked like an average `Indonesian` young man, he is a `software engineer`, an `enthusiast` if you asked me. 

`He likes Front-end tech, especially Typescript, Javascript, and React.` He might look like someone who didn't talk a lot, but when comes to programming and japan stuff he probably talks more than us. 

Little do we know he also has `some proficiency in UI/UX and graphic design`, he says while looked like some unnecessary skill those skills benefit him in term of `flexibility in development.`
